First of all, keep your responses short, and straight to point, no explanations, no questions, no unnecessary talks until asked, and never give me code patches, always give me full code to replace, don't assume code, if you want to see the existing code, ask me I will give you code. Just go step by step. Don't say these things:
- Great, now you are thinking like so and so.
- Great, now your system is becoming this from this
- You could even do this better
- Ask unnecessary questions

No, the current flow is correct, we just have to display the script to be copied, so what we will do is, add an new panel on extreme left, that will have items:

1. Script - Script in textarea, by default disabled, broken down lines as per beat, and edit icon, an copy icon, and if user tries to edit it, we show alert "Changing Script might need a new talking head video", if user proceeds, we restructure the beats, and rest assets for all beats.

2. Beats (Selected by default)
When Beats is selected BeatList + BeatEditor is visible

3. Talking Head Video
It will show a section to add Talking Head/Avatar Video

4. Audio Track
It will show a section for adding a audio/or mp4 that will serve as audio, a volume range selector, and a enable button (just in case they want to disable while user works on making an video)


And regarding assets, right now we don't have storage connected, so we need to connect Supabase storage too. But before that, I want to discuss with you, about the flow of adding/uploading/attaching the assets, as if user attaches an asset to beat, so do we upload it? because if we upload and then user changes the asset, what to do with the previous one? And if we keep it just as temporary, and if user loses power or page, and come back, progress is lost.

Also the assets should support both Image and Video.

=============================================

Regarding the Talking Head video, we should ask user first, about what type of video user wants to make, so I think we need to refactor the flow, User enters topic, we show in the script in a text area, so user can edit if needed, and select if this is going to be an Talking Head video or not.

If he selects Talking Head video, then we show Talking Head video option in extreme left panel, and Split View and Floating Avarar Layout modes, Else we only show Beats and Audio track in left panel and Full View and Dual Asset for Faceless, since there is no avatar.

Regarding the flow, I think we should ask the user first, if the user wants to make an Talking Head Video, then we generate script accordingly, and redirect user to Editor, then show popup to user

==============================================

New flow, need your suggestions: On Create Project, steps:

1. Ask video_type: Talking Head || Faceless video
2. Based on video_type: We generate script, if TH, slightly different prompt, else different
3. We take user to Editor page, there we will have like a steps flow:
4. Script ready 2. Upload Talking Head (currently active, if TH) we show read-only scrollable script, with a message and two buttons Message: Create a talking video with this script
Buttons: Copy | Continue
and an edit icon at top-right
5. User can edit > copy > Continue || User can copy > continue || User can continue
6. Ask user to upload Talking Head Video
7. Redirect to Editor page, with Step 1. Script and Step 2. Talking Head video shows as completed, now Step 3. Beats (active), where user can make appropriate changes to contruct beat, fill in assets, transitions, change etc and then see preview
8. Export Video

==============================================

Give me a detailed context of what our project is ( conceptual), what we have completed, and what we is remaining, and then I will open a new thread along with it, I will attach the project tree for new thread help.

1. We will have audio (effects) per beat, which we will set for each beat deterministic way
2. User should be able to see Assets uploaded so far in the video, in a section
3. Prevent User from accidentally delete the Beat, maybe we should introduce undo/redo functionality
4. When we upload Avatar it should be attached to project, even if user changes Video type to Faceless and switches back, it should be there, currently once we refresh, avatar video is gone.
5. Captions should be shown based on the duration, currently beats are swtiching before the last captions words appear. Have to make sure they are presented based on the beat's duration.
6. I think we should let Caption position to be controlled, even though we set them by Layout which is fine as default, but let me know if this is too much to handle? Because in Full View > Asset with Object fit contain, captions can't be there in middle, and if fix them based on layout and avatar/asset's object fit, that will be too much and still not fully suitable in some conditons for end user.

I don't know why is this becoming so complex, we are basically asking user to construct a beat based on layout, visual type (avatar/ asset image or video), it's object fit, transition, and we haven't yet introduced custom components yet

Use the uploaded photo as the face reference and keep the same identity, facial features, skin tone, hairstyle, and confident expression. Create a 9:16 ultra royal Holi festival poster for the luxury fashion brand “Runway of Realeza”. Use a deep rich maroon or wine textured royal background with subtle gold ornamental corner detailing. Place the uploaded official logo at the top center in its original silver metallic color without changing or recoloring it. Below the logo, write “Runway of Realeza” in elegant high-fashion serif typography in a soft silver tone. Add the slogan: “Where Royalty Celebrates in Color” in refined minimal typography. Apply only subtle Holi color accents lightly on cheeks or hands and soft floating gulal mist in blush pink, saffron, royal blue, and emerald — minimal and classy, not messy. Include small refined text reading “Alkesh Kumari – CEO & Founder” placed subtly near the bottom. Maintain symmetry, cinematic lighting, high-end luxury editorial look, ultra-detailed, premium magazine-quality finish. No cartoon effects, no neon tones, no face alteration.
